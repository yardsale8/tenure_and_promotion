First, I will demonstrate teaching effectiveness. Appendix G of the Master
Agreement provides examples for demonstration of teaching effectiveness and I
will focus on instructional innovation, assessment of student learning,
curriculum design, the effectiveness of course design, and support activities
for teaching and learning.

### Instructional Innovation and the Assessment of Student Learning

To illustrate my approach of blending 
[instructional innovation with the assessment of student learning]({{<relref path="instructional_innovation.md">}}), 
I will start with a discussion of
changes made to various face-to-face and online sections of STAT 110
Fundamentals of Statistic, including implementing the flipped classroom,
developing an online interactive set of course notes, adapting to both
asynchronous and synchronous online courses, implementing an innovative and
effective assessment scheme, and using informal in-class assessment of
student learning to improve on learning activities.

### Curriculum Design

Evidence of excellent [curriculum design]({{<relref path="curriculum_design.md">}}) 
will start with a discussion of the
development of two new data science (DSCI) courses: DSCI 330 The Management
of Unstructured Data and DSCI 430 Data Science at Scale. Then evidence of
excellence in curriculum design will be provided in the development of
curriculum for two other courses, redesigning the DSCI 210 Data Science and
implementing an innovative project for STAT 310 Intermediate Statistics.

### Support Activities for Teaching and Learning

Beyond effective and innovative course design, effective teaching also
demands excellence in other soft skills such as prompt effective feedback and
communication. I will demonstrate my ongoing attempts to make improvements to
these [support activities for teaching and learning]({{<relref path="support_activities.md">}}).

### The Effectiveness of Course Design

To demonstrate my effectiveness in [course design]({{<relref
path="course_development.md">}}) for a wide variety of statistics and data
science topics, I will discuss the wide variety of courses that I have
designed four and a half years since joining the Mathematics and Statistics
Department at Winona State.

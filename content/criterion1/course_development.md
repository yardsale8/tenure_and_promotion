I have placed a lot of value on feedback from student evaluations and I have
tried to illustrate how I use this feedback throughout the portfolio. For
example, in-depth evaluation of student feedback related to the flipped
classroom in [the section building student-centered curricula]({{<ref
"/criterion4/student_centered.md">}}). 

{{< figure src="/img/STAT110_evals_instructor.png" title="**Figure 1.** Student responses to questions about the instructor from all regular sections of STAT 110 from Fall 2016 to Fall 2020 (excluding summer courses).  A large majority of the students agreed or strongly agreed that the instructor was available, cared, and enthusiastic; as well as providing clear explanations, effective teaching, and helpful answers.">}}

One of the other areas of my student evaluations to which I pay particular
attention. The first is the block of questions devoted to the instructor of
the course. **Figure 1** shows the student responses from all spring and fall
STAT 110 sections from 2016-2020. As you can see, the majority of the students
were pleased with the instruction in the course.

While I am focusing on STAT 110 here (the course that I have taught the
most both in terms of sections and students), you will find similar responses
in the reports for most classes, which are provided in the next section.

Below you will find links to the student evaluations for all[^1] of my
courses. A more thorough evaluation of these results will be providing
as part of my tenure and promotion applications.

    team-taught with Dr. Chris Malone, who was the primary instructor. I
    donâ€™t have evaluations for this course.

Next, I will demonstrate my accomplishments in the area of scholarship.
Appendix G of the Master Agreement provides examples for demonstration of
scholarship and I will focus on the development of five teaching web
applications (technologically delivered academic products), the presentation
of talks and posters at national meetings (presentations at professional
meetings), and organizing and running pre-conference workshops on the Winona
State approach to teaching data science (collaboration in the scholarly
growth of peers and other scholars).

### Developing Web Applications for the Teaching and Learning of Statistic

I have created five web applications that can be used in the teaching and
learning of statistics in introductory and upper-division courses. The first
three applications build on the pedagogical approach pioneered by my
colleagues Drs. Hooks and Malone, but offer a more modern interface than the
previous solution while being freely available on the web. These applications
represent my most substantial creative and scholarly work, are used in the
classroom by a majority of the statistic faculty at Winona State, and have
even been featured in a presentation by my colleague Dr. Chris Malone.

### Presentations at National Conferences

My second area of scholarly activity involves the dissemination of my
colleagues' as well as my own ideas about teaching data science and I will
discuss my related presentations and a poster, all but one being presented at
national meetings on statistics and data science.

### The Development and Delivery of Workshops on Teaching Data Science

Finally, I will discuss the other way that I and my colleagues have
contributed to the data science education community: running four
pre-conference workshops on various topics on teaching data science,
culminating the workshop that I spearheaded that presented by the entire WSU
data science faculty on the Winona State core data science curriculum.

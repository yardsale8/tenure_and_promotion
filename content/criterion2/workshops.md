Over the last four years, I have created and executed four pre-conference
workshops in collaboration with my WSU colleagues. These activities fall under
the category of growth of peers and other scholars (See Appendix G of the
Master Agreement) and constitute a major part of my scholarly and creative
output since joining the Department of Mathematics and Statistics in 2016.

I will start with a discussion of the USCOTS 2019 pre-conference workshop
decimating the WSU core data science curriculum that was presented by all six
data science faculty. I took the leadership role in conceptualizing,
proposing, and organizing the program for the workshop and there is evidence
of a resounding success. I see this workshop as the crowning jewel in this
area.

The section is rounded out with a discussion of a sequence of three workshops
on data visualization that I planned and executed with my colleague Dr. Silas
Bergen. The opportunity to present three workshops on similar content allowed
us the opportunity to hone the content and delivery, and resulting in a
polished and successful workshop at SDSS 2019.

By the end of this section, you will see ample evidence of meaningful
contribution to the scholarly growth of peers and other scholars.

## A Core Curriculum for Undergraduate Data Science, USCOTS 2019, College Station, PA
 
{{< figure src="/img/uscots19_core_banner.png" title="**Figure 1.** The entire WSU data science faculty presented our core data science curriculum in a 2-day pre-conference workshop at USCOTS 2019. On top of being in charge of the original proposal and the subsequent organization and division of labor, I also contributed to half of the design and implementation of sessions .">}}

For years, the data science faculty at WSU have been expressing a desire to
share our DSCI curriculum with a larger audience. In January of 2018, five of
these faculty attended a workshop on data science curriculum. Our takeaway
was we have a head start on the conceptualization and development of data
science curriculum and should find a venue to share what we have learned.

Based on our many discussions on this topic, I submitted a proposal for a
16-hour pre-conference workshop at USCOTS 2019 ([available
here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VBNfOcqOWcI8C5cVFfuV9Jy7s2FajHGcrCiRgzX0hck/edit?usp=sharing))
that was ultimately accepted. The resulting workshop consisted of 4 four-hour
sessions, one dedicated to each of the following topics: the introductory
course, data visualization, the management of data, and statistical learning
theory. We believe that these four topics should form the core of any
data science curriculum and hoped to convince the audience that all programs
should include courses on each.

{{< figure src="/img/uscots19_core_block_1_and_3.png" title="**Figure 2.** The two blocks that I help create and present scored high in terms of overall quality, presentation, and the quality of the break-out activities.">}}

I create and present two of the four blocks, collaborating with Dr. Chris
Malone to the first block (The Intro Class) and Drs. Hooks and Kerby on the
third (Data Management). As shown in **Figure 2**, both of these sections
score high in overall format, presentation, and the quality of break-out
activities. 

Finally, I would like to highlight our success on two additional goals by focusing on some responses to the questions *What were the most valuable aspects of the workshop?* (**Most Valuable:** ) and *If you were to implement one thing from the workshop, what would that be?* (**Implement**). 

First, we wanted to make it clear that data science was a science
in its own right and it is not sufficient to simply bundle up existing data science and statistic courses. The following comments suggest that we hit the mark. 

* **Most Valuable:** "*For me, the most valuable aspect was to learned what is data science and how to teach it. As a statistician I never thought about the cleaning and manipulation of data, only when necessary. So it is interesting to see part of a course dedicated to this*"
* **Most Valuable:** "*breaking several myths and pre-conceived notion I have about data science being a statistician*"
* **Most Valuable:**"*All aspects of the workshops are very valuable. The understanding that DS should not be just a combination of stats courses and CS courses is new to me, and a great advice.*"
* **Implement:**"*The most important takeaway I got from this workshop is the philosophy of teaching data science--the fact that it is distinct from statistics and the importance of understanding data science ideas apart from a particular programming language. I hope to help my school build a DS program that is more than a repackaging of existing math/stat/comp. science courses.*"

Next, we think that it is important to develop curriculum *software or
technology agnostic*. Instead of teaching a specific technology, you should
instead teach core concepts, and then translate them to various platforms.
The following comments suggest we were also successful getting this idea
across.

* **Most Valuable:** "*Loved the software agnostic activities and want to incorporate that more into our courses!*"
* **Most Valuable:** "*The very "hands-on" activities that emphasized software-agnostic learning of data science concepts.*"
* **Most Valuable:**"*I LOVED the on-paper data wrangling exercises. And just learning more about the overall structure of your program was helpful; you'd obviously thought a lot about what skills were important, etc.*"
* **Implement:**'*I am definitely going to add more non-programming data wrangling to our stats course that teaches dplyr. It will be a useful first step that we are currently missing.*"
* **Implement:**"*Software agnostic activities*"

{{< figure src="/img/uscots19_core_overall.png" title="**Figure 3.** Participants were very satisfied with the workshop overall.">}}

In the end, we hoped that we could put together a workshop that provides value
and insight on the creation of a data science program. Responses to the
participant survey, in particular the participant ratings on the overall workshop shown
in **Figure 3** and the comments highlighted above suggest that we were very
successful.

## Data Visualization Workshops 

Next, I will discuss a series of three workshops that I developed in
collaboration with Dr. Bergen. The final result was an invitation to present
a pre-conference workshop presented at SDSS 2019 that was a resounding
success.

#### Web Scraping and Data Visualization with Python ad Tableau. USCOTS 2017 

{{< figure src="/img/uscots17_banner.png" title="**Figure 4.** Dr. Bergen and I ran a USCOTS workshop that took participants through the entire data cycle.">}}

In May 2017, Dr. Silas and I ran a [USCOTS pre-conference
workshop](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots17/workshop/2) that
took the participants through the entire data cycle. In the first half of the
workshop ([material available
here](https://github.com/WSU-DataScience/USCOTS2017_workshop)) I taught the
participants focused on teaching the basics of the Python programming
language, followed by the basics of web scraping. After the participants had a
handle on basic Python tools, they were introduced to scraping the web using
the Beautiful Soup module. Then, they learned the basic theory around
visualization, which was subsequently applied to the data from the Current
using Tableau.

{{< figure src="/img/uscots17.png" title="**Figure 5.** Almost all participants found my portion of the workshop useful.">}}

My portion of the workshop was well-received. **Figure 5** illustrates that
almost all participants were satisfied. I would also like to share a note
regarding the workshop that one happy participant sent to Dr. Nicole
Williams, Chair of the department.

> Dear Professor & Department Chair Williams,
>
> I am sending to a quick note to compliment your department and
> university for hiring Dr. Silas Bergen and Dr. Todd Iverson.  It
> is *not *a routine practice of mine to take the time to contact
> the leadership of workshop presenters.  But, in this case, I wanted to
> do so.  
>
> I was deeply impressed by the 2-day workshop on Web Scraping & Data
> Visualization that Drs. Bergen & Iverson provided last week at the
> U.S. Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS).  It was clear that
> both of them have developed not only the content knowledge, but that
> they also continue to hone their pedagogical knowledge for
> facilitating the knowledge and skills of their learners in the
> emerging field of data science.  From what I was able to discern, they
> had a tall order to fill because there was much variation in the prior
> knowledge and skills of those of us who enrolled in the workshop.  I,
> for one, was completely new to the software they used (Python and
> Tableau) while others appeared to know one or the other, or a similar
> type of program making the transfer more easily.  Still, what was
> particularly noteworthy about both Silas and Todd, was their
> attentiveness to my struggles.  Rather than dismiss me as one who
> would not "get it," they each took the time to sit near me, while the
> other was presenting, and offer countless help, as needed. And, while
> doing that, they also showed awareness of the other learners and
> addressed their needs, too.  Their patience and kindness were much
> appreciated.
>
> While I am not seeing myself as a future "web scraper," I felt that
> the exposure I received from Todd will be very helpful to me as I now
> better understand the process others go through, including the
> potential for errors, when creating more manageable "big data" sets.
>  The exposure to data visualization was quite intriguing and set the
> stage for the conference's opening talk (which highly reflected ideas
> Silas covered) and other sessions I attended where additional software
> (besides Tableau) was introduced.  I appreciate how Silas took the
> time to first cover the Elementary Perceptual Task (EPT) principles
> that underlie quality visualizations before working with Tableau.  
>
> This is turning into more than a quick note, so I will conclude here.
>  In sum, it is my impression that your department and university are
> fortunate to have Dr. Bergen and Dr. Iverson.  Undoubtedly, they will
> continue to grow professionally and benefit not only their students,
> but faculty colleagues, as well.
>
> Sincerely,
>

There were also several positive
comments (see comments 1 and 2 below), but there was still some room for
improvement. You can access the entire [participant
survey here](https://ql.tc/qxmm0k), but I would like to share four comments, two
positive and two on suggested improvements.

*  “*Finally learning Python and seeing how to implement it in a data science context!*” 
* “*The mini-tasks in both the Python and Tableau portions were incredibly useful to learn as we went.*” 
* “*I felt the Python portion was a little fast-paced, but I was able to catch up on the breaks.*” 
* “*A lot of material to cover in the time allotted. It could be longer or the two topics could even be split into two workshops*,” 

The last comment, in particular, rang true and we have taken this feedback to heart
in subsequent workshops by shifting the entire focus to data visualization.

#### Data Visualization Theory and Pedagogy, ICOTS 2018, Kyoto, Japan

{{< figure src="/img/icots18_banner.png" title="**Figure 6.** Dr. Bergen and I ran an ICOTS workshop focusing on data visualization theory and pedagogy.">}}

In July of 2018, Dr. Silas Bergen and I presented a workshop on the
foundation of data visualization theory and pedagogy at [ICOTS
2018](http://icots.info/10/?workshop=E) in Kyoto, Japan. In contrast to our
first workshop, which blended two separate topics over four 4-hour blocks,
this time we devoted our time exclusively to data visualization. We focused
on three components of visualization: the grammar of graphics, the elementary
perceptional task, and graphic design gestalt principles throughout
four 1-hour sessions. While we had a very low response rate, the results of a
participant survey are available here: [Participant
Survey](https://ql.tc/e3IGkD).

{{< figure src="/img/icots18_block2.png" title="**Figure 7.** I developed and ran the second block of the workshop, which compare introduced visualization in Altair (Python) in hopes of reinforcing the concepts of the grammar of graphics introduced in the first block.  This portion of the workshop was not as well-received as I would like, but I was improved the following year (see **Figure 9**)">}}

I was in charge of the second block, which was designed to reinforce the
concepts from the grammar of graphics by constructing visualizations using
the Altair in Python. Unfortunately, this part of the workshop was not as
well-received as I would like. The pacing of this block was off,
resulting in spending too much time "in the weeds" and not enough looking at interesting visualizations.  The effect of this mismanagement of time can be seen in the participant responses in **Figure 7** as well as the comments provided below.

* "*I wasn't particularly interested in learning Python, so have less opinion about that. I wasn't quite sure how the Python portion and Tableau portion fit together*"
* "*A little less detail on inner workings of Python, so we would have time to get more interesting graphs.*"

Luckily, I was able to address these issues in a workshop the following summer (see below).

#### Data Visualization Theory and Pedagogy, SDSS 2019, Belleview, WA

{{< figure src="/img/sdss19_banner.png" title="**Figure 8.** Dr. Bergen and I were invited to run a workshop on data visualization at SDSS 2019.">}}

Dr. Bergen and I were invited to present our workshop on data visualization
at a [pre-conference workshop for SDSS
2019](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2019/onlineprogram/Program.cfm).
This was our second time presenting this workshop (see above), and we made a
number of improvements.

{{< figure src="/img/sdss19_block2.png" title="**Figure 9.** Again, I in charge of the second block of the workshop, but this time we compared the code for visualization in Altair (Python) and ggplot (R) to reinforce the concepts of the grammar of graphics introduced in the first block.">}}

Based on participant feedback from the last workshop, I made several changes
to the second block of the workshop. Instead of getting bogged down in the details of Python and Altair, participants compared the code for visualizations constructed with the Altair in Python and ggplot in R. This was a more successful approach (compare **Figures 7 & 9**).  Full results of the participant survey are [available here](https://ql.tc/zcaZSK) and I have provided a number of positive responses below.

**Select responses to "What were the most valuable aspects of the workshop?"**
* "*... I also really liked learning how to use ggplot in Python, altair, and Tableau. I felt like the examples and activities used in the teaching sessions were well structured and I took away some good tips to use in my teaching.*"
* "*Hands on application of grammar of graphics theory in ggplot and altair.*"
* "*Showing altair and ggplot side-by-side was very useful, as were the exercises and lastly seeing the capabilities of Tableau.*"
* "*... I also really liked learning how to use ggplot in Python, altair, and Tableau. I felt like the examples and activities used in the teaching sessions were well structured and I took away some good tips to use in my teaching.*"
* "*... The side by side of ggplot2, which I know very well, and Altair, which I know nothing about, is great.*"
* "*Hands on application of grammar of graphics theory in ggplot and altair.*"


## Conclusion

Throughout this section, evidence was provided of a successful, well-received
series of workshop that provided an avenue to decimate the data science
curriculum developed at WSU and contributed to the growth of my fellow data
science educators.

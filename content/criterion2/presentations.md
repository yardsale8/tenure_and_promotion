Many areas of data science require strong programming skills and I have given
several presentations in recent years on two topics: introducing software
development best practices into data science curriculum and talking data
management algorithms starting with data verbs.

## Teaching Data Science Students to Write Clean Code

For close to 10 years, I have had the opportunity to teach students
programming on one level or another; be it introductory/advanced CS or
various DSCI courses. One worry that I have had (and I suspect I share with
other STAT/DSCI instructors) is how to go about evaluating and improving
studentsâ€™ code. This year, I have spent some time learning what the experts,
namely experienced software engineers, had to say about clean code. In this
section I will discuss two presentations that shared what I have learned.

### Evaluating Name, Southern MN Stat Chat at St. Olaf College, April 26, 2019 

{{< figure src="/img/names.png" title="**Figure 1.** I shared what I have learned about evaluating the quality of variable and function names at the Southern MN Stat Chat.">}}

My first talk on clean code focused on evaluating the quality of variable and
function names in code and was presented at the Southern MN Stat Chat at St.
Olaf College, April 26, 2019. This talk has become a regular feature in my
DSCI 330 course and parts of this material were incorporated into the next
talk

### Teaching Data Science Students to Write Clean Code, SDSS 2019, Belleview, WA.

{{< figure src="/img/clean.png" title="**Figure 2.** The clean code talk tells the story of Doug, a budding data scientist intent on cleaning up his code, earning an A, and thwarting his nemesis--the mean Dr. Iverson.">}}

A second extended talk on teaching students to write clean code was presented
at the 2019 Symposium on Data Science & Statistics (SDSS 2019) in Belleview,
WA. This talk built on the last, but also illustrated the importance of
teaching students to refactor code and run unit tests. The talk had a unique
format, presenting the material by telling the story of a fictitious data
science student intent on getting an A.

Dr. Kelly McConville, Associate Professor of Statistics at Reed College and
program chair of the SDSS 2019, attended the talk and I asked her for comments.
Here is what she had to say in her [letter of
support](/testimonial/mcconville_letter_of_support.pdf).

> I would also like to address Dr. Iverson's presentation skills as I felt that
> he gave the audience a good understanding of him as a teacher. Dr. Iverson
> has a fun, playful, and rather self-deprecating presentation persona. I can
> see this persona making him very accessible to his students. He taught the
> audience about writing clean code (a rather dry topic usually) through a fun
> fictional story about a student assignment where the student is the hero and
> the professor (Dr. Iverson) is the villain. His student iterates through
> refactoring their code, going for rather messy code to nice, clean code.
> Throughout the iterations, Dr. Iverson gives us concrete suggestions of ways
> code should be refactored and clearly explains why these are good practices.
> He used pictures, highlighted code chunks, and even stick figures to help
> tell the story in a clean and engaging way. He reinforced the key takeaway
> messages throughout the talk and provided us with useful additional resources
> at the end. I was wildly impressed with the amount of effectively covered
> content in his talk.

Next I will discuss two presentations, a poster and a talk, on teaching data
management with data verbs.

## Data Management with Data Verbs

{{< figure src="/img/verbs.png" title=" **Figure 3.** Dr. Chris Malone and I submitted an extended abstract (pictured in part here) that was peer-reviewed and accepted as a talk for SDSS 2020.">}}

Over the last two years, I have been collaborating with Dr. Chris Malone on
implementing a new data science curriculum focused on data verbs. We
presented our initial work in a poster at SDSS 2019 (Dr. Malone was the
primary author) and our extended abstract on this topic was accepted as [a
talk for SDSS 2020](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/sdss/2020/onlineprogram/Program.cfm) (I
was the primary author and presenter--see **Figure 3**). I discuss each presentation below.

### Using Data Verbs to Teach the Management of Tabular Data, SDSS 2019, Belleview, WA.


Dr. Chris Malone (primary author) and I presented on our approach to teaching
data verbs in a software/technology agnostic fashion at SDSS 2019. This is
material that has grown out of our DSCI 210 introductory data science course,
but we think will also influence other areas of the curriculum such as DSCI
325 The Management of Structured Data and DSCI 430 Data Science at Scale. I
gave a follow-up talk on our efforts the following year.

### Data Management with Data Verbs, SDSS 2020, Virtual. 


{{< figure src="/img/verbs_talk.png" title=" **Figure 4.** My SDSS 2020 talk shared many of the ideas and activities on teaching data management with data verbs developed in collaboration with Dr. Chris Malone .">}}

This talk presented our updated approach and encouraged the audience to teach
data management in a software-agnostic style (discussed in more detail in the
section on [curriculum development]({{<ref
"/criterion1/curriculum_design.md">}}). The talk incorporates our previous
activities for teaching data management with data verbs, as well as new
material on teaching the management of unstructured data through data
origami.

## Summary

Communicating our work with a wider audience is an important part of academic
work, and in this section, you have seen evidence of effective dissemination
of new approaches to data science curriculum at both local and national meetings.

For me the joys of teaching are two-fold. 

First, I take a lot of pleasure in continually improving the pedagogy,
curriculum, and administration of my various courses. My primary focus when
making improvements is student learning, which I believe outweighs all other
concerns in academia. I will provide evidence of these concerns by
discussing my efforts to [develop student-centered curricula]({{<ref
"student_centered.md">}}).

Second, I treasure the opportunity to have a lasting impact on my student's
lives. Few other fields that allow one to make a lasting impact on
so many individuals and we get the added benefit of working with young
adults--which keeps us young at heart. My impact on Winona State students
is be evidenced by [assisting in the scholarly growth of students]({{<ref
"growth.md">}}) and through [various advising activities]({{<ref
"advising.md">}}), be it academic advising or advising a capstone experience.

By the end of this section, you will see a substantial and sustained
contributions to student growth.

One way to promote the scholarly growth of students is through
out-of-the-classroom activities that accentuate their in-class learning.
Next, I will highlight two such activities: my work advising students participating
in data analytics competitions and a workshop that I developed for the Women
in Computer Science (WiCS) student organization.

## Advising MinneMUDAC and MUDAC competitors

Starting in the 2016-2018 fall semesters, I have taken an active leadership
role in organizing and advising students competing in the MUDAC and
MinneMUDAC data analytics competitions. Participating in a data analytics
competition provides students an important opportunity to apply what they
have learned while working on a real-world problem with a team of peers.

At the start of each competition, I collaborated with Dr. Chris Malone to
hold meetings with the participants in the weeks leading up to the main
event. We held these gatherings once or twice a week and used the time to
prepare the students for the competitions, particularly in two areas. First,
we reviewed the problem as well as techniques that the teams could use to
answer the corresponding questions. Second, we spent time reviewing strategies
for effectively presenting the student's findings.

These competitions have been a successful and meaningful experience for our
students and many of the WSU teams have performed well. For example, a WSU
team placed in the top five in the undergraduate division in the
MinneMUDAC 2016 competition and won the award for Serendipitous Discovery (see
**Figure 1**). The following year saw even more success for WSU teams, with
two teams winning First Place Overall and the Acumen Award, respectively, and
another two teams receiving Honorable Mention in the MinneMUDAC 2017
competition (**Figure 2**). We saw similar success in the MUDAC 2018 competition with WSU
teams placing first, fourth, and eight in the overall competition (out of 36
teams) and our teams performed exceptionally well in the new prediction
accuracy portion of the competition, placing first, second, and sixth (**Figure 3**).

While I can't take full credit for the success of our teams, as we have very
hard-working and talented students, I would like to think that organizing and
administering the biweekly meetings before each competition contributed to not
only the success of our teams, but more importantly to students' growth as
statisticians and data scientists. I should also note that, in addition to
advising Winona State student teams and organizing study sessions, I also
helped organize and run the MUDAC 2016, MUDAC 2017, and MUDAC 2018
competitions hosted here at Winona State; those contributing the student
scholarly growth of students from neighboring schools.


## WiCS Workshop on Web Scraping

{{< figure src="/img/WiCS_workshop.png" title="**Figure 1.** I presented a workshop, organized by the Women in Computer Science student organization, on web scraping with Python.">}}

This the spring semester of 2018, two former/current students asked me to
develop and present a workshop for the Women in Computer Science (WiCS)
students organization. The resulting workshop was based on the USCOTS
pre-conference workshop and introduced the students to scraping the web with
Python. The workshop ran for 2.5 hours and was attended by about 55 students.
While I donâ€™t have formal feedback from the participants, informal comments
suggest that the workshop was a success.

For me the joys of teaching are two-fold. First, I take a lot of pleasure in
continually improving the pedagogy, curriculum, and administration of my
various courses. Second, I treasure the opportunity to have a lasting impact
on my student's lives. Next, I will provide evidence of substantial
contributions to student growth and development.

### Using the Flipped Classroom in STAT 110

{{< figure src="/img/flipped_word_cloud.png" title="**Figure 1.** All sections of STAT 110 over the last five years have been implemented using the flipped classroom.  The word cloud highlights common words from students' comments on the flipped classroom.">}}

Starting in the fall semester of 2016, STAT 110 were implemented using the
[flipped classroom pedagogy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom), 
with lectures were provided outside of class in the form of short videos embedded in an online
textbook and class time reserved for supplemental activities design to reinforce the material. students worked on homework in class. 

{{< figure src="/img/flipped_response.png" title=" **Figure 2**: STAT 110 students were asked to comment on the flipped classroom. The following table summarizes the responses with a large majority of the students giving a positive response. ">}}

Research indicates that the flipped classroom can be effective. For example,
[Zheng et al. (2020)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/26915403)
performed a meta-analysis on 95 studies that involved 15,386 participants and
found that the flipped classroom had a moderate effect on both learning
achievement and learning motivation. Additionally, they were able to show
that watching teaching videos before each class had the largest effect on
learning.

{{< figure src="/img/act_and_videos.png" title=" **Figure 3**: STAT 110 students were asked to comment on the flipped classroom. The following table summarizes the responses with a large majority of the students giving a positive response. ">}}

In light of these findings, I wanted to look at my students' opinions of this
approach. First, I looked at their response to the out-of-class videos and
in-class activities. **Figure 3** provided a summary of student responses to
two questions about both the out-of-class videos and in-class activities. In
all cases, a large majority of students either strongly agreed or agreed
that

1. The activities were enjoyable and beneficial and
2. The videos were understandable and that they watched them all.

{{< figure src="/img/sentiment_SVD.png" title=" **Figure 4**: A latent sentiment analysis and singular value decomposition was performed on the student evaluation responses to *Comment on the flipped classroom*.  A summary and exemplar of typical responses in each region is provided.">}}

Finally, I was interested in exploring the students' written responses when
prompted to respond to the flipped classroom. To help organize the responses
from hundreds of students across four-plus years of running the course, JMP
was used to perform a latent sentiment analysis and singular value
decomposition. **Figure 4** provides a summary of the findings, where we find
a cluster of very enthusiastic students in the top right, complaints about
the time and efficacy of videos in the bottom right, and short positive and
negative responses in the top and bottom left, respectively.

    To further illustrate the enthusiam of some of the student responses, I have
selected several additional comments from the top right quadrant, which are
provided below.

> LOVED. Gave us time to work on assignments and ask questions while we were doing the assignments [2]
> 
> I liked being able to ask questions in class while doing the assignments [8]
> 
> I liked this because then while in class, you could ask for help on the activities and ask questions about unclear things in the lectures. [9]
> 
> I loved this. It allowed me to take quality notes and if i wasn't quite understanding a concept I had the opportunity to go back and watch the video again. Coming to class and doing the activities was super beneficial. I liked being able to talk problems out with my peers and being able to ask you questions when needed. [17]
> 
> So much better than the normal way. Gave me more time out of class and made for better grades on assignments. [33]
> 
> Ii liked the style of the flipped classroom, but it would've been nice to be also be able to work on homework outside of class, instead of in groups in class all of the time. [48]
> 
> I really liked this approach and I think that it is a great way to teach students. I think that it allows them to ask questions in class if need be and it really breaks down the material. [55]
> 
> It was helpful at times because I was able to ask hw questions in class, but the material is a little bit more difficult to memorize when its flipped classroom [79]
> 
> I really liked the flipped classroom becauseI liked being able to work through the work together and ask questions. [97]
> 
> I think it was good overall because most of the homework I definitely would not have been able to figure out on my own. I liked it even more when we started doing more in class activities rather than just group work. [107]
> 
> I liked the flipped classroom. It gave us a chance to do in class work and we were able to get help if we had questions. [110]
> 
> i did not mind it. As long as I read the book at home and looked through the powerpoints, I understood the material on the group work and the professor was able to answer any questions I had and clarified material during group work [119]
> 
> I like the flipped classroom approach because I was able to come to class with questions and get help on the homework in class. [120]
> 
> as i said before, I really liked it! gave me time to do hw in class and watching the videos on my own time and really getting to know it was nice! [123]
> 
> I most definitely preferred when the professor would talk and work on the assignments with us. I think I learned the material much better this way. [136]
> 
> I liked working on activities in class so that you can ask questions. [168]
> 
> I liked doing the activities in class because that way if you had questions, you could ask the professor right away. [174]
> 
> I loved the flipped classroom! I think that it gave students the best understanding for the class. I would rather learn in class and do my homework there than have to read textbooks [182]
> 
> if every class did that (and more and more are) students get bogged down with too many hours of watching lectures plus homework assignments plus studying and working. I like having the information available but it has a potential to increases the work load too high. [192]
> 
> I really liked this approach! I think this really aligned with my style of learning and it helped a lot that class time you put what you learned to work with assignments while being able to work in groups. [237]
> 
> I liked it, for some modules I would have wanted a lecture however. But I think it made class time more useful. College is mostly peer collaboration anyways, so being able to contribute and better that skill through this class was super nice. All students are at a different pace, so he let us work on our own and if we were confused we knew where we could find him, he would answer the questions then and there rather than having to go to office hours. That was also nice. [251]
> 
> I didn't like the flipped approach because I have become accustom to taking notes and learning in class and sometimes had a difficult time doing group activities when group members were also confused [256]
> 
> I liked it, because we already knew what we were going to do in class and it gave us time to ask you questions in class if needed. [260]
> 
> It was an interesting change as this is the first time I had done something like this. I believe that this approach with an incompetent professor can be potentially disasterous; however, Professor Iverson's setup with clear, online videos along with examples and help in the physical classroom made it work out very well. [267]
> 
> I actually liked being able to know what we were going to work on being able to have my peers and professor available when we got stuck on certain questions. [286]
> 
> Sometimes watched videos or read before class and group work everyday [287]
> 
> I liked this approach because I was able to read and watch the material before class and come to class with questions.  I also though working on the assignments with a group and asking questions as I did the assignments was helpful. [288]
> 
> I liked this approach cause it gave me more of an opportunity to ask questions about topics I was confused on. [290]
> 
> Enjoyed it. Gave me a better understanding to watch before and then discuss material to help that understanding. [295]
> 
> I didn't like the activities outside of class.  I didn't like how if we were confused we couldn't ask questions. [297]
> 
> A great resource to understand the material on our own time and get help when needed in class [299]
> 
> I did not always read the textbook chapters assigned before class but other than that I liked the flipped approach. Working in groups and having the professor available for questions was extremely helpful [320]
> 
> I prefer this approach for this stats class because it allows students to ask the professor questions while completing the work which otherwise could not be asked if the work was done at home. [332]
> 
> I think this helped me a lot because I was able to ask my homework questions in class [344]
> 
> Personally, I did not like it, but others might! I like learning over the material in a classroom setting and not by myself incase I have questions or am confused. [368]
> 
> The flipped approach was good it was helpful you will have a better understanding of  the material. However, even if some did not I feel that your teaching is so thorough in class that, you wouldn't feel behind even if you didn't read or watch the videos. [379]
> 
> I actually enjoyes the flipped classroom approach, because I feel I learn better outside the classroom. It however leave more responsibility on myself and I would sometimes forget to do the assignments. [385]
> 
> I thought the flipped approach was a great way to learn statistics. I enjoyed being able to ask questions during class. [387]
> 
> I enjoyed the flipped approach. It was very helpful to have time for homework in class so I could talk with my group members and Professor Iverson when I had questions. [392]
> 
> I have never been apart of it before it was nice to be able to ask questions as we were working on the assignment in class. I did feel a little rushed doing the assignments in class [409]
> 
> I enjoy this more than a typical classroom setting, working in class with people gave me the opportunity to ask questions and make friends. [415]
> 
> I liked it. Being able to use class time to ask questions was beneficial. [417]
> 
> I didn't mind it because if i was confused on a part during the lecture, I would come to class and would be able to ask my group or the professor. [437]
> 
> It help because it gave me time to ask questions in class instead of outside of class [449]
> 
> I liked it, it gave us time to ask questions on assignments [456]
> 
> I liked it, the online vidoes were helpfull and it was nicin being able to ask questions in class when I needed help. [460]

In summary, I am very pleased with the design and effectiveness of the
flipped classroom applied to STAT 110. I believe that this class, in
particular, is a good fit for this pedagogy; as it is home to a large number
of nursing majors who are very willing to put in the extra time. While I
don't have explicit proof demonstrating improved student learning, my
sense--based off of years teaching this material with a standard approach--is
that it also fosters better outcomes.  

Finally, spending semester after semester in the flipped classroom has made
me a better instructor. It is hard to state how much I have learned, and
subsequently improved the course material, by directly observing the students
as they work together and ask questions.

### Building an Online Textbook for STAT 110

{{< figure src="/img/text_word_cloud.png" title=" **Figure 5**:  This word cloud highlights common words from students' comments on the online textbook I put together for STAT 110.">}}

At my previous place of employment, I used an online textbook in an
introductory programming course which was developed by Brad Miller and David
Ranum from Luther College. This online textbook framework rethinks the role
of a textbook in the age of the internet by allowing authors to embed videos
and assessment questions in the body of the book. Furthermore, these authors have
released an open-source Python library that can be used to construct your own.

{{< figure src="/img/book_MC.png" title=" **Figure 6**:  An example of the multiple-choice assessments that are embedded in the online course textbook I designed for STAT 110.">}}

I decided that this type of book would be a good match to the flipped
classroom approach to STAT 110. During the 2016-2017 academic year, I
converted Dr. Tisha Hooks' course notes into such an online textbook. In the
process, I made some adjustments to match the material to my preferences--in
particular, introducing confidence intervals using on the StatKey
website--and embedded short video lectures and multiple-choice The current
version of the book can be found using [this link](https://yardsale8.github.io/stat110\_book/)

Here is a list of some of the book’s features. The book

1.  Starts with an introduction to data and statistical studies,
    including a focus on constructing sentences to describe parameters
    and statistics.

2.  Uses the StatKey website and the bootstrap to introduce confidence
    intervals for quantitative data.

3.  Introduces association for two quantitative variables and uses the
    bootstrap to perform inference using the StatKey website.

4.  Uses the Hooks/Malone approach of introducing hypothesis testing
    through simulation.

{{< figure src="/img/book_comments.png" title=" **Figure 7**:  A summary of responses from student evaluations for the Fall 2017 term of STAT 110. A majority of the students like the online textbook (right-hand plot), identifying cost, ease of access, embedded lecture videos and embedded assessments as positive elements (left-hand plot).">}}

At the end of each semester, students are asked to comment on the textbook.
**Figure 7** gives a summary of the results from the Fall 2017 semester. We
can see that a large majority liked the book (right-hand plot) and elements
that they found helpful (left-hand plot).  In particular, there was some
very strong feedback related to the embedded multiple-choice questions that
students could use for self-assessment. Here is an example of such a
response.

> *Yes, I thought It was useful. I liked \[t\]he few questions you would
> provide at the bottom of each section or video. I appreciated the
> comments that went along with it, wheather \[sic\] I got the question
> right or wrong, there was always a comment explaining why that was the
> answer, which really helped me understand i\[t\] better. *

While putting together the online interactive textbook for STAT 110 was
time-consuming, it has paid enormous dividends over the last five years. In
particular, this approach has made moving to online teaching, both
asynchronously in the summers and synchronously in response to COVID-19, much
more manageable and I would encourage anyone to give it a try.

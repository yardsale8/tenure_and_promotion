Over the last five years, I have completed six of online
courses (participating continuing education courses and/or formal
education/study--Appendix G of Master Agreement). These courses cover a 
wide breadth of topics, including functional programming, distributed computing,
building client-server applications, and finally a course on developing
online and blended courses.

By the end of this section, you will see evidence of a substantial and formal
course of study, which is had an impact on developing and updating curriculum
in data science.

## Completion of Online Courses in Data Science

The first four courses are were completed to prepare for the development of
three new data science elective, a special topics course on functional
distributed programming in the spring semester of 2017 and two new elective
approved and implemented in 2018 and 2019.

#### Complete a Coursera Course on the Hadoop Platform

The [Hadoop framework](https://hadoop.apache.org) supports distributing the
storage and processing of very large quantities of data across many machines
and is used by [many social media and tech
companies](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/HADOOP2/PoweredBy)
such as eBay, Facebook, and Twitter. In preparation for teaching a special
topics course in the spring of 2017, I completed a Coursera course on the
Hadoop framework during the 2016 fall term. 

The curriculum for this course included an overview of the basic components
of the Hadoop framework, as well as the basics of writing MapReduce and Spark
applications. Completing this course was a positive experience that directly
impacted the curriculum in STAT 489 and inspired the associated textbook.
This course also led me to learning the Spark SQL framework, which is
featured in the DSCI 430 course developed the following year.

The certificate for completion of this course can be seen by navigating
this [link](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/QRTQKUPSZDRY).


#### Two Courses on Functional Programming in Scala

In anticipation of designing and implementing DSCI 430 Data Science at Scale,
I completed 2 Coursera courses during the 2017 summer break. The first
introduced functional programing in the Scala programming language and the
second built on the first by teaching functional design principles in Scala.
Spark, the primary focus of DSCI 430, is written in Scala and while this
course uses the Python bindings to Spark, it was still beneficial to learn
about the under-pinnings of the framework. Below you will find the
certificates for the completion of each course.

#### Cleaning Data in Python

One of the topics in covered in DSCI 430 Data Science at Scale is the process
of cleaning data. To make sure that my understandings of cleaning data in
Python was up-to-date, I complete a [DataCamp](www.datacamp.com) course on
this subject. The completion of this course helped me formalize a
step-by-step process for cleaning data, as well as introduced me to some
effective techniques for online courses. The certificate of completion is
[available here](testimonial/data_camp_data_cleaning.pdf).

#### Elixir—Developing with Elixir/OTP

In addition to building client-side educational application, like those
highlighted under [criterion 2]({{<ref "/criterion2/software.md" >}}). While
the Elm programming language is great for creating responsive modern
client-side applications, it requires an interface with another language when
creating client-server applications. 

During the 2019 fall semester, I started to gain the requisite knowledge to
build a server-side client by completing a [Pragmatic Studio course on
Elixir](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elixir). Elixir is a language
that is built on top of Erlang and is tailor-built for the sorts of tasks
completed by a server-side client. In particular, I really liked the actor
model that was employed and streamlined by Elixir.

Another benefit of completing a course like this one is seeing the
author’s pedological approach to online learning. In this case, the
couple that creates the videos perform the lectures in tandem and switch
off presenting topics; timing the transitions when a topic changes or
when making a counterpoint. They also had good transitions between
showing them talking to the camera and them talking over a computer
screen or terminal. 

## Complete the WeTeach Courses on Teaching Online and Blended Courses

This last summer, over the last four summers, I had the opportunity to teach
STAT 110 in the online format. Then COVID happened. While I had sat in on the
WeTeach course in my first year at WSU, I thought it was to time revisit (and
actually complete) this course. This summer, I re-enrolled and completed in
the WeTeach course offered by Minnesota State, which focus on the best
practices for teaching online and blended courses. I have fully completed the
course (see the [attached certificate](/testimonial/WeTeachCertificate.pdf)).

One of my takeaways from retaking this course was just how much the first
time through has impacted my course development. WeTeach encourages extra
organization and communication with students and I am happy to say that my
online courses meet these goals. In the flip side, taking the course
reinforced that I can improve my courses by building better rubrics for
improving the communication of my expectations and feedback.

One of the goals of the WeTeach courses is to introduce the requirements for
certifying a course under Quality Matters and encourage faculty to apply for
this certification. I am in the process of setting up STAT 110 to meet the
expectations, and also plan to submit the DSCI 611 course that I am creating
for HLA for certification.

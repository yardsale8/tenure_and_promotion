The state of the art in data science evolves at a rapid pace and I go to
great lengths to make sure that my data science courses include the most
modern tools and procedures, be it building fast, easy-to-use educational web
applications or cutting-edge data management tools. In her [letter of
support](testimonals/quam_letter_of_support.pdf), Mariah Quam--a recent data
science graduate--spoke to my willingness to incorporate new technologies in
my courses.

Keeping oneself up-to-date with a rapidly-evolving field requires an ongoing
course of study, be it formal coursework or self-guided study. In this
section, I will highlight my efforts to expand my knowledge and stay current
in the expanding field of data science. By the end of the section, readers
will have seen substantial evidence of continuing preparation and study in
the form of

* participating in [continuing education courses, and/or formal education/study]({{<ref "continuing_education.md">}}), 
* engaging in a [structured study leading to the development of experimental programs, curricular proposals or revisions, and ongoing revisions to course syllabi or instructional methods reflecting currency in the discipline or its pedagogy]({{<ref "other_structured_study.md">}}), and 
* attending [professional meetings and conferences]({{<ref "meetings_and_conferences.md">}}) (See Appendix G of the Master Agreement).

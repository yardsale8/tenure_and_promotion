First, I would like to highlight three contributions to the mathematics,
statistics, and data science education community.

### USCOTS 2021 Planning Committee

As discussed in a [section on criterion 2]({{<ref
"/criterion2/workshops.md">}}), I have conducted several workshops on
teaching data science, two of which were conducted at the United States
Conference on Teaching Statistics (USCOTS). This year, likely due to these
workshops, I was asked to serve on the planning committee for USCOTS
2021--co-chairing the planning of the pre-conference workshop. Planning this
year's conference has been a challenge--it is being run virtually--and I am
excited to serve in this capacity for a conference that has had a big impact
on my career.

### Data Visualization in Python, SDSS 2019, Belleview, WA

{{< figure src="/img/invited.png" title=" **Figure 1**: I organized and chaired an invited session for SDSS 2019 that brought in experts to teach the audience about data visualizations in Python.">}}

At the request of Dr. Silas Bergen, I organized an invited session for the
2019 Symposium on Data Science & Statistics (SDSS 2019) that focuses on
inducing the audience to data visualization in Python. The first speaker,
Stephen Elston from Quantia Analytic, introduced the audience to the
MatPlotLib and the Seaborn libraries. This talk was designed to provide easy
access to standard statistical visualizations. The second and third talks
focus on Altair, which provides a visualization framework that (a) is based
on the Grammar of Graphics, (b) allows visualization to be hosted on at sites
such as GitHub and (b) is built on the Vega and Vega-Lite frameworks. These
talks were presented by Dominik Moritz from the University of Washington
and Kanit "Ham" Wongsuphasawat from Apple; two contributors to both Vega and
Altair.

### A Course on Teaching Data Science, Project Next, 2020

Shortly after earning a Ph.D., I was able to participate in Project NExT, a
professional development program for new/recent Ph.D.s. This program had a
big impact on my career and this year I had the opportunity to give back. Dr.
Chris Malone and I taught a short course on teaching data science described
below.

> The curriculum for an introductory data science course varies tremendously as
> the definition of data science depends on oneâ€™s perspective. This workshop
> will discuss how the curriculum for our introductory data science course has
> changed so that students who have a diverse background in computing can
> succeed. Best practices, including specific examples, for the teaching of an
> introductory data science course will be presented.

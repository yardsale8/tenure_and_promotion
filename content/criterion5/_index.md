Since joining Winona State, I have made respectable contributions in service
to both Winona State and the statistics and data science education
communities. First, I will highlight [my service on many
departmental and university committees]({{<ref "university.md">}}) which will
be followed up with a discussion of activities in [service to the greater
statistics and data science education communities]({{<ref "community.md">}}).

By the end of this section, you will have seen evidence of a level of service
expected from a tenure associate professor.
